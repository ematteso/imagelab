# ImageLab

ImageLab is a framework that allows students to develop
image modification processors (filters) and to experience
the results visually and aurally. This project can be ran as a BlueJ Project, directly from the command line, or built with a gradle wrapper.

- The __imagelab__ and __sound__ packages may be provided in an `imagelab.jar` file.
- The `imagelab.jar` file also includes the class __Run__ with a `public static void main` method in the unnamed package, used to facilitate running the ImageLab application.
- The __filter__ package is generally provided as a folder with source (`.java`) and compiled (`.class`) files, with the source versions serving as examples for students to create their own filters.
- A sample set of images are provided in an __"images"__ directory.

## Build Instructions 

### Build System Requirements
- Install Gradle
  * Gradle is the tool used in this repository for automation of the build. Please visit https://gradle.org/ for specific installation instructions.
 
### Creating an executable jar file
The project is set up to use gradle wrapper to create the jar file.
1. Change the working directory to be the project's root directory.
2. Execute the command `./gradlew build`
   A. This will build/rebuild the jar file and required dependencies.
3. The new jar file will be named "imagelab.jar" and located in the project's root directory.

More information on gradle can be found [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) and more information on the gradle wrapper can be found [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

If there is no automated build environment set up, the jar file can be created using the `jar` command.
1. Change the working directory to be the project's root directory.
2. Execute the command `javac Run.java` to compile the Run.java file.
3. Execute the command `javac */*.java` to compile/recompile the files in packages imagelab, sound, and filters.
4. In the root directory execute the command `echo Main-Class: Run > MANIFEST.MF` to create the manifest file for the jar.
5. Create the jar using the command `jar cfm imagelab.jar MANIFEST.MF *.class sound/*.class imagelab/*.class`
6. The new jar file will be named "imagelab.jar" and located in the project's root directory.

More information on creating the jar can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html) and more information about java commands can be found [here.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/index.html)

An executable jar file can also be created within most IDEs.
